This repo provides an example for using PeanutButter to TDD
your EntityFramework-based project. Each commit should be a
step of interest, if I don't get ahead of myself.

Commit comments should explain what's going on. I'd suggest
using a friendly git client which allows you to easily check
out a specific commit so you can run through all commits from
the beginning to the end to get an idea for the process.
